# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview
`gh-pt` is a GitHub CLI extension for installing release binaries from GitHub repositories across Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD. It supports both interactive and non-interactive workflows, checksum verification, distro/hardware detection, packaging formats (deb, rpm, pkg, appimage, flatpak, snap), archive extraction (`mholt/archiver/v4`), and atomic state management (`state.json` via `flock`).

## Agent Initialization - New Chat

- Load the following skills: tdd, using-superpowers, ast-grep, golang-how-to, verification-before-completion, concise-output, ponytail, wayfinders

- Activate gh-pt with serena mcp

## Key Commands & Workflow
```bash
# Build
make build
# or: go build -v -o gh-pt .

# Run Tests
go test -v ./...

# Format & Lint
make fmt
make lint
make tidy
```

## Architecture & Codebase Map
- `main.go`: Validates `gh` presence, initializes config, parses arguments with `alecthomas/kong`.
- `cmd/`:
  - `root.go`: Command routing (`RootCLI.Run()`), default install type heuristics, distro detection (`/etc/os-release`, `ID_LIKE`), and hardware acceleration detection (NPU `/sys/class/accel`, GPU `/dev/dri`).
  - `state_mgmt.go`: State inspection, removal (`--rm-saved-state`), uninstallation logic per package manager (`dpkg -r`, `rpm -e`, `pacman -R`, `pkg delete`, or `os.Remove`), and pin management (`--pin`).
  - `update.go`: Update runner (`-U`/`-u`), replaying installation params from state entries while preserving pin rules; delegates git repository syncing (`gh repo sync`) for cloned and forked apps.
- `params/params.go`: Kong struct tag definitions for all CLI flags (including `--clone` and `--fork`), environment variable bindings (`GH_PT_*`), and custom types.
- `release/`:
  - `release.go`: GitHub REST client (`cli/go-gh/v2`), asset matching, checksum discovery & verification (SHA-256 / SHA-512), extraction, and permission management.
  - `name_cleaner.go`: OS/architecture/version affix removal heuristics for normalized binary renaming (`GenerateCleanName`).
- `selector/`:
  - `selector.go`: Regex builder (`buildRegexFromTypes`) and priority asset filtering.
  - `interactive_selector.go`: TUI/interactive prompts using `pterm`.
- `state/state.go`: XDG data store (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/gh-pt/state.json`) with file-locking (`flock` on `state.json.lock`), supporting binary releases and `Clone`/`Fork` tracking.
- `config/config.go`: XDG configuration parsing (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gh-pt/config.yml`), including custom `clone_path` and `fork_path`.

## Critical Implementation Rules & Gotchas
1. **GitHub CLI Prerequisite**: Authentication and presence of `gh` CLI is mandatory.
2. **State & File Locking**: Always operate through `LoadState()` and `Save()`. Never bypass `state.json.lock`.
3. **Deletions on State Removal**: `RmState` uninstalls tracked packages or removes target binary files directly from disk.
4. **Testing Before Completion**: Run `go test -v ./...` and `make lint` on any Go codebase modifications.
5. **Consider all OS permutations**: When adding or modifiying a feature, consider if it'll work for Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, Windows 11, Mac OSX, Debian, FreeBSD, Pop OS!, Kali, etc.te
6. **Must function interactively as well non-interactively** Ensure that no interactive appear by default that will break non-interactive script execution (Requiring sudo prompt on sudo cache invalidation is to be expected however)

## Critical Asset Matching Test Scenarios

These scenarios are essential for validating asset selection behavior:

1. **Foreign Architecture Blacklisting**: Never install a release with a SPECIFIED foreign arch. Foreign architectures (unless explicitly specified by user via `--allow-foreign-arch`) are blacklisted matches that instantly disqualify a release from consideration after a match is recognized. Example: On amd64, reject `app_linux_arm64.tar.gz` even if it matches other criteria.

2. **No Architecture = Assume Compatible**: If a package has no architecture specified in its filename, assume it is compatible with the current system architecture. Example: `app_linux.tar.gz` should be considered valid on amd64.

3. **Final Fallback Pattern**: The absolute last fallback is `{item name}.{accepted file type}`. This pattern must be matched at the end after failing to match: version number, OS, (on Linux: distro), architecture, and libc (gnu/glibc vs musl). The final fallback accepts any file with the correct extension, regardless of metadata.

4. **Type Priority per Platform**: Ensure appropriate type priority and OS/arch priorities for the system gh-pt runs on. Linux systems prioritize deb/rpm/appimage, macOS prioritizes dmg/pkg, Windows prioritizes exe/msi. Each platform has its own arch preference order.

5. **Success Message**: Ensure a green success message is printed on successful installation completion.
7. **Explicit Success/Failure Feedback**: Every command must yield a clear success message upon completion, or a clear failure message including the reason for failure. Silently failing is forbidden, as clear output is necessary for users and integration testing.
